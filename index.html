								<h1>About me</h1>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/elegant_lesser.jpg" alt="" /></span>	
								<p>Born in Albania, raised in Italy I now live in the States where I know I can best fulfill my ambitions. So what are my ambitions? Well, I consider myself an avid problem solver. This goes beyond my professional life: the way I go about life is by considering it a sequence of different size problems. This has shaped my mind to always look for ways to provide the best solution I can come up with. Therefore, my commitment to computer science and engineering has felt very natural as they make up great tools for problem solving. And the great thing is that it also works the other way: computer science is a great tool for solving problems, but to effectively use computer science you also need to solve problems. This is the perfect playground where computer science not only became my career goal but constitutes my main source of fun in my free time. Game developing, Android mobile programming, AI demonstrations, 3D & 2D rendering software, old console emulators, website development: these are part of the things I engaged in in my free time in these past years. I love technology, developing Software and all you can achieve having these skills. I strongly believe that, theoretical computational limits aside, there's very little things I can't achieve with the skills I possess. I am convinced that having this drive is the premise for a successful career in Computer Science and I am convinced as well that any recruiting company will highly benefit from it. My ambition is to find the right place to build on this drive, I thrive in a motivated and ambitious environment and I look forward, with a lot of excitement, to committing to what is next.</p>

									<h4>Afterword</h4>
									<p>I want add that part of my computer science education comes from independent and personal work to either integrate a specific class (e.g. computer architecture or computer graphics) or to learn something new (e.g. Rust programming language or asynchronous programming). One of my favorite activities is to take on new projects that focus on particular aspects and learn the most out of them. For this reason, my university education does not necessarily represent the only source of my knowledge regarding computer science (and engineering). I believe that effective learning is a very valuable non-technical skill (especially in such a dynamic field as Computer Science) and, thanks to this, I was able to hone this skill over the past years.</p>

								<h2>Work Experience</h2>
								<p>In the first semester of 2019 I was part of the Department of Psychiatry at University of Illinois at Chicago as a graduate employee. My main duties were in the field of connectomics research. In particular, after a first period of catching up with the background knowledge, my main focus was in the analysis and visualization of brain data in the Human Connectome Project using Matlab and Python. The aim of the analysis was to shed light on Alzheimer's disease. FILL IN FILL IN FILL IN FILL IN FILL IN FILL INnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn                                     </p> 
								<h2>Top Expertise</h2>
								<p> I have a very strong Software Engineering foundation. With this foundational knowledge the programming language becomes just a tool to favor a specific use case or a tool that provides frameworks that are needed for specific applications. The programming language can therefore be considered as a design choice based on requirements and specifications (albeit not always a stringent design choice). So I find my strongest theoretical and practical foundation in Software Engineering and in particular:</p>
								<ul>	
										<li>
 							 				Developing applications with particular and meticulous attention to the <b>software life-cycle</b> stages (feasibility, requirement analysis, design and development, unit and integration testing)
 							 			</li>
 							 			<li>
 							 				<b>Object Oriented Environments</b>
 							 			</li>
 							 			<li>
 							 				<b>System Programming</b>
 							 			</li>
 							 			
 							 			<li>
 							 				<b>Relational Databases</b> and SQL environments, Semi-structured data and RDF datasets, the Semantic Web
 							 			</li>
 							 			<li>
 							 				Partially practical and solid theoretical knowledge in <b>Computer Graphics</b>
 							 			</li>
 							 			<li>
 							 				Strong foundational knowledge in <b>Computer Architectures</b> 
 							 			</li>
								</ul>
								<h4> Programming Languages </h4>
								<p>Paul Graham in his <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">essay</a> about Programming Languages talks about the Blub Paradox to represent that tendency of programmers to settle with a specific programming language, knowing why their favorite programming language (called "Blub" to avoid hurting anyone's feelings) is better than all other programming languages lacking a particular feature they are really comfortable with, but oblivious to what is better thinking that the better programming languages are equivalent to Blub, but they just have a different, more complicated, syntax. Since the programming language shapes the programmer's way of thinking about Software Engineering, they are going to be very resilient to a change. Getting into Computer Science that programming language for me was <b>Java</b>. Java makes programming very easy as strongly oriented at OOP that allows the programmer to focus on the high level design of the code, as well as removing pointers that are a common source of bugs. This comes at a cost: things as the JVM and/or garbage collection may lower performances. This becomes a problem when performances is an important non-functional requirement. Quoting Paul Graham in his essay, <blockquote>programming languages vary in power. <...> If you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.</blockquote> I think this is a very profound principle that distinguish a Software Engineer from a programmer: You can easily write a non trivial client-server application in Java, but most likely writing the same application in C++ may result in a faster program and if we take this one step further, using Rust may improve the safety (in terms of memory and/or concurrency) of the program. In light of this, I've explored many programming languages ideal for the tools they provide for use cases. This made me confident in the process of learning new programming languages & technologies. I have meaningful previous experience with:
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Rust</b> for system programming and client-server applications</li>
									<li><b>Python</b> for data analysis</li>
									<li><b>Matlab</b> for analysis in the medical field</li>
									<li><b>Java</b> for complex software systems that benefit from high level of abstraction</li>
									<li><b>C/C++</b> for system programming</li>
									<li><b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>Javascript</b> for web development</li>
									<li><b>SQL</b> for Relational Databases</li>
									<li><b>SmallTalk</b> for didactic GUI application</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
								Having touched on many programming languages, it's hard to keep track of all the different syntactic differences, therefore my current and main programming language is <b>Rust</b>. This ultimately means that on top of the characteristic features of it, Rust is the language I mostly recall the syntax of, as well as its idioms. Regarding the other programming languages, thanks to the strong Software Engineering foundation, I am confident it would be a straightforward and smooth transition to new programming languages.</p>
